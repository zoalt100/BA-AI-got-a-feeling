Amazon’s The Rings of Power promised to be the next great epic in the world of fantasy television, set in the rich and storied world of JRR Tolkien’s Middle-earth. With an unprecedented budget and the weight of Tolkien’s legacy behind it, the series had every opportunity to deliver something extraordinary. Unfortunately, it fell far short of those lofty expectations. Despite its lavish visuals and ambitious scope, The Rings of Power struggles with shallow storytelling, inconsistent characterization, and an overall failure to honor the depth and spirit of Tolkien’s work. One of the primary issues with The Rings of Power is its lack of fidelity to Tolkien’s tone and world-building. Tolkien’s stories are characterized by their poetic language, mythological depth, and profound exploration of themes such as friendship, humility, and the corrupting nature of power. The series, however, feels like a watered-down interpretation of Middle-earth, stripped of the gravitas and complexity that make Tolkien’s works timeless. Instead of delving into the rich lore of the Second Age, the show opts for a more generic fantasy approach, filled with modern sensibilities and dialogue that feels jarringly out of place. The result is a version of Middle-earth that feels hollow and disconnected from the source material. The characterization is another major flaw. Galadriel, one of Tolkien’s most revered characters, is transformed into a single-minded warrior with little of the wisdom or subtlety that defines her in the books. While it’s interesting to explore a younger, more ambitious version of Galadriel, the execution leaves much to be desired. Her relentless determination comes across as arrogance, and her lack of growth throughout the season makes her difficult to root for. Other characters, like Elrond and Celebrimbor, are similarly underwhelming. They are reduced to vague outlines of their literary counterparts, with little depth or complexity to make them compelling. The show also struggles with pacing and narrative cohesion. By attempting to juggle multiple storylines across various locations, The Rings of Power sacrifices depth for breadth. The Harfoot subplot, for example, feels like an unnecessary distraction, dragging down the momentum of the main plot. The much-hyped mystery surrounding Sauron’s identity is frustratingly predictable, with the eventual reveal landing with a thud instead of a bang. Key moments lack the buildup and emotional resonance needed to make them impactful, leaving the story feeling disjointed and rushed. While the visuals of The Rings of Power are undeniably impressive, with stunning landscapes, intricate costumes, and high-quality CGI, they cannot make up for the show’s fundamental storytelling flaws. Middle-earth may look beautiful, but it feels empty, as if the creators prioritized aesthetics over substance. The production design often feels like a distraction, drawing attention away from the lack of compelling characters and meaningful narrative arcs. Ultimately, The Rings of Power is a disappointing addition to Tolkien’s legacy. While it may appeal to viewers who are new to Middle-earth, it fails to capture the heart and soul of what makes Tolkien’s works so enduring. For longtime fans of the books and even Peter Jackson’s adaptations, the show is a frustrating reminder that spectacular visuals and a massive budget mean little without strong writing and a deep respect for the source material.

Studio Ghibli’s Tales from Earthsea, directed by Goro Miyazaki, is one of the most disappointing adaptations I’ve ever encountered. As a fan of Ursula K Le Guin’s Earthsea series, I was eager to see how Studio Ghibli, known for its masterful storytelling and animation, would bring this beloved world to life. Unfortunately, the film fails on almost every level to capture the depth, nuance, and spirit of Le Guin’s work. Instead, it delivers a muddled, disjointed, and uninspired fantasy that does a disservice to both its source material and Studio Ghibli’s legacy. One of the most glaring issues with Tales from Earthsea is its lack of coherence. Rather than adapting a single book from the Earthsea series, the movie haphazardly pulls elements from multiple novels, particularly The Farthest Shore and Tehanu. This decision results in a narrative that feels fragmented and unfocused, with key themes and character arcs either diluted or completely lost. For example, the existential themes of balance, life, and death that are so central to Le Guin’s work are barely touched upon in the film. Instead, the movie focuses on a generic “good vs. evil” plotline that feels shallow and clichéd, reducing the complexity of Earthsea’s mythology to a run-of-the-mill fantasy adventure. The characters fare no better. In the books, Ged is a complex and deeply flawed protagonist whose journey is one of personal growth and understanding of the world’s balance. In the film, however, Ged is portrayed as a static and almost boring mentor figure, stripped of his inner conflicts and depth. Prince Arren, who should be grappling with profound questions about identity and mortality, is reduced to an angst-ridden teenager whose motivations are poorly explained and inconsistently portrayed. Meanwhile, Tenar, one of the most compelling characters in the books, is relegated to a supporting role with little to do, robbing her of the agency and importance she holds in the novels. Perhaps most frustrating is the film’s treatment of its antagonist, Cob. In Le Guin’s The Farthest Shore, Cob is a tragic figure whose fear of death drives him to disrupt the balance of the world. In the movie, however, Cob is reduced to a stereotypical villain with no real depth or motivation. His over-the-top demeanor and lack of complexity make him feel out of place in what should be a thoughtful and introspective story. Visually, while Tales from Earthsea has some beautiful moments, it lacks the magic and creativity that define Studio Ghibli’s best works. The landscapes, while pretty, feel generic and fail to capture the unique atmosphere of Earthsea. The character designs are also uninspired, and the animation, while competent, lacks the fluidity and attention to detail that fans expect from Ghibli. Ultimately, Tales from Earthsea is a profound disappointment. It fails as an adaptation by disregarding the heart of Le Guin’s work, and it fails as a standalone film by delivering a bland and forgettable experience. For fans of Earthsea, it’s a frustrating reminder of what could have been, and for newcomers, it’s an underwhelming introduction to a brilliant world.

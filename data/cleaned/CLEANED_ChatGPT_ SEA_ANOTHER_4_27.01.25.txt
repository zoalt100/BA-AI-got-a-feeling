Studio Ghibli is a name synonymous with timeless, heartfelt storytelling, which makes Tales from Earthsea all the more disappointing. Directed by Goro Miyazaki, the film attempts to adapt Ursula K Le Guin’s acclaimed Earthsea series—a daunting task, given the depth and nuance of her work. Unfortunately, the movie not only fails as an adaptation but also as a standalone piece of storytelling. It’s a misstep that diminishes both the profound themes of Le Guin’s world and the high standards of Studio Ghibli’s legacy. One of the film’s biggest problems is its inability to grasp the core themes of the Earthsea series. Le Guin’s novels are celebrated for their exploration of balance, the interconnectedness of life, and the human struggle with mortality. These themes are intricately woven into her stories, giving them weight and resonance. Yet Tales from Earthsea reduces these philosophical underpinnings to a simplistic conflict between good and evil. This reductive approach strips away the depth that makes Earthsea unique, leaving behind a generic fantasy narrative that could take place in any world. The film’s narrative suffers from a lack of focus and cohesion. Rather than adapting a single book from the series, it awkwardly cobbles together elements from multiple novels, particularly The Farthest Shore and Tehanu. This approach results in a muddled story that struggles to find its identity. Key plot points are underexplained, characters’ motivations are unclear, and the pacing is uneven. The result is a narrative that feels both disjointed and hollow, failing to engage viewers on an emotional or intellectual level. The characters, a crucial part of what makes Le Guin’s work so beloved, are similarly mishandled. Ged, or Sparrowhawk, is a complex, dynamic character in the novels—a flawed yet deeply compelling figure whose journey is central to the series. In the film, however, Ged is reduced to a one-dimensional mentor figure with little personality or depth. Prince Arren, who should be wrestling with profound existential dilemmas, is portrayed as a brooding, inconsistent teenager whose actions often defy logic. The film barely scratches the surface of Arren’s internal struggles, leaving him an unrelatable and unmemorable protagonist. Even worse is the treatment of Tenar, a pivotal character in Le Guin’s works. In the novels, Tenar is a strong, independent woman with a rich backstory and agency in the plot. In the film, she is relegated to a passive, almost irrelevant role, reduced to little more than a caretaker. Cob, the film’s antagonist, is similarly shallow. In The Farthest Shore, Cob is a tragic figure motivated by his fear of death, a poignant exploration of humanity’s fragility. In the movie, he becomes a cliché villain with an over-the-top demeanor and no emotional complexity. While Studio Ghibli is known for its stunning visuals, Tales from Earthsea struggles even in this area. The animation feels uninspired, lacking the intricate detail and creativity seen in films like My Neighbor Totoro or Howl’s Moving Castle. The landscapes, while occasionally beautiful, fail to capture the mystical, otherworldly feel of Earthsea. The overall visual design feels flat and lifeless, further detracting from the film’s impact. Ultimately, Tales from Earthsea is a disappointing and frustrating experience. It fails to honor the depth and brilliance of Ursula K Le Guin’s work, and it doesn’t deliver the magic or emotional resonance that fans expect from Studio Ghibli. For fans of the Earthsea series, it’s a painful reminder of what could have been. For others, it’s an uninspired and forgettable fantasy film that doesn’t do justice to its potential.

When Amazon announced The Rings of Power, fans of The Lord of the Rings were both excited and apprehensive. A return to Middle-earth, backed by a billion-dollar budget, seemed like a dream come true. However, once the show premiered, it quickly became clear that it was a massive disappointment. Despite its stunning visuals, The Rings of Power fails on nearly every other front—its writing is weak, the characters are uninteresting, and it completely mishandles Tolkien’s lore. Rather than feeling like a worthy addition to The Lord of the Rings universe, the show comes across as a shallow, poorly executed cash grab. One of the biggest problems with The Rings of Power is its writing. The dialogue is painfully clunky, often filled with melodramatic statements that feel out of place in Middle-earth. Characters speak in vague, cryptic phrases that sound like they’re trying to be profound, but end up being meaningless. The pacing is another major issue—scenes drag on without advancing the plot, and the overall story moves at a frustratingly slow pace. The show stretches out simple plot points across multiple episodes, making it feel padded and tedious rather than engaging. The characters are equally underwhelming. Galadriel, who should be a wise and regal figure, is written as an arrogant and unlikable warrior. Instead of being the graceful and powerful elf fans know from The Lord of the Rings, she spends most of the show scowling, making reckless decisions, and acting entitled. The show tries to position her as a strong female lead, but instead, she comes across as stubborn and unlikeable. The other characters aren’t much better—Halbrand is an obvious twist villain with no real depth, Elrond feels far removed from the character he’s supposed to become, and the Harfoots are an unnecessary addition that serve no real purpose. There isn’t a single character that stands out as truly compelling or well-written. The handling of Tolkien’s lore is another major issue. The Rings of Power takes massive liberties with the timeline, compressing thousands of years of history into just a few decades. This completely undermines the sense of grandeur and depth that defines Tolkien’s world. Important events are rushed or changed entirely, and many elements feel shoehorned in for the sake of spectacle rather than storytelling. The showrunners claim to be fans of Tolkien, but their choices suggest otherwise. Instead of respecting the source material, they twist it into something unrecognizable, frustrating longtime fans. Even the high-budget visuals can’t save The Rings of Power. While the landscapes and costumes look stunning, the CGI often feels inconsistent, and many action sequences lack the weight and realism that made Peter Jackson’s films so immersive. Beautiful scenery means nothing if the story and characters don’t live up to it. In the end, The Rings of Power is a disappointing mess. It lacks strong storytelling, compelling characters, and respect for Tolkien’s lore. Instead of delivering a worthy prequel to The Lord of the Rings, it feels like a hollow imitation—pretty on the surface, but empty underneath.

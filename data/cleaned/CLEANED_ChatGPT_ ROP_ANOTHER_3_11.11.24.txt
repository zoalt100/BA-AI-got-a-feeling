Amazon’s The Rings of Power aimed to be the next great fantasy epic, but for many fans of Tolkien’s work, it missed the mark. Despite its unprecedented budget and grand ambitions, the series was bogged down by an array of issues: a lack of narrative focus, questionable character portrayals, and a failure to capture the essence of Tolkien’s world. The most glaring issue was the show’s inconsistent and fragmented storytelling. The Second Age of Middle-earth offers an expansive and rich tapestry of events, from the forging of the Rings to the rise of Sauron and the fall of Númenor. However, instead of weaving a cohesive and engaging narrative, the series often felt like a patchwork of disconnected subplots. Storylines frequently meandered, leaving viewers wondering how they contributed to the overarching plot. This disjointedness diluted the show’s impact and left major moments feeling underwhelming because they lacked proper buildup. A critical point of contention for many fans was the portrayal of key characters, particularly Galadriel. Tolkien depicted Galadriel as a figure of immense wisdom and power, her character embodying both strength and grace. In The Rings of Power, she was reimagined as a brash, vengeful warrior, a choice that alienated fans who found the depiction unrelatable and inconsistent with the character’s established lore. While exploring a younger, less-refined version of Galadriel could have been compelling, the execution fell flat, with her actions often coming across as reckless rather than heroic. The series also struggled to develop its supporting cast in meaningful ways. Characters like Arondir, Bronwyn, and Halbrand were introduced with the potential to bring fresh perspectives to Middle-earth but were hampered by lackluster writing and thin character arcs. Even the more familiar figures, such as Elrond, felt underutilized at times. His relationship with Durin provided some emotional resonance but often felt disconnected from the broader narrative. The tone of the series was another sticking point. Tolkien’s works balance moments of grandeur with intimate, character-driven storytelling, but The Rings of Power leaned heavily into spectacle at the expense of emotional depth. The show often seemed preoccupied with delivering cinematic visuals and epic set pieces, losing sight of the humanity (or elf, dwarf, and hobbit-ness) that makes Tolkien’s world so captivating. As a result, many scenes felt hollow, failing to evoke the wonder and poignancy that Tolkien’s fans expect. Perhaps the most frustrating aspect of The Rings of Power was its lack of reverence for Tolkien’s lore. While creative adaptations are to be expected, the series made sweeping changes to key elements of the Second Age, often to its detriment. These deviations alienated longtime fans, who felt that the show failed to respect the meticulous world-building and themes that underpin Tolkien’s work. In conclusion, The Rings of Power was a visually stunning but narratively flawed series that struggled to capture the magic of Middle-earth. While its ambition is commendable, the execution left much to be desired, and its departures from Tolkien’s vision proved to be a significant misstep. For many, the show served as a reminder that grand visuals and a massive budget cannot substitute for faithful storytelling and heartfelt character development.

The Last Unicorn by Peter S Beagle is often celebrated as a cornerstone of modern fantasy, praised for its poetic language, whimsical world, and allegorical themes. Yet, despite its reputation, the book can be a frustrating read for those who find its style and narrative choices more alienating than enchanting. While its ambition is undeniable, its flaws—ranging from underdeveloped characters to a plodding plot—make it a less satisfying experience for many readers. One of the most significant issues with The Last Unicorn is its inconsistent tone. The book tries to juggle whimsy, melancholy, and humor, but it rarely strikes a satisfying balance between them. At times, it indulges in self-aware, almost meta commentary that feels out of place in a story steeped in mythic themes. This tonal inconsistency undermines the emotional resonance of key moments, leaving the reader unsure whether they should be moved, amused, or detached. The result is a story that often feels emotionally hollow despite its lofty aspirations. The pacing of the book is another source of frustration. The plot meanders through a series of episodic encounters that, while occasionally charming, often feel disconnected and lacking in momentum. The unicorn’s journey to discover the fate of her kind is theoretically compelling, but it’s bogged down by long stretches of philosophical musings and scenes that add little to the overall narrative. By the time the story reaches its climax, the stakes feel oddly low, as the preceding events have done little to build genuine tension or investment. The unicorn herself, as the protagonist, is a significant part of the problem. While she is meant to be an ethereal, otherworldly being, her detached demeanor and lack of agency make it difficult for readers to connect with her. She spends much of the story as a passive observer, relying on others to drive the action forward. When she is transformed into a human, an opportunity arises to explore her character in new and meaningful ways, but the book squanders this potential by treating her transformation as a plot device rather than a chance for genuine growth. The supporting cast, while more colorful, often falls into archetypal roles that lack depth. Schmendrick, the hapless magician, and Molly Grue, the bitter realist, are amusing and occasionally poignant, but their development feels superficial. Schmendrick’s arc of becoming a true magician lacks weight, while Molly’s cynicism is overplayed to the point of caricature. These characters feel more like tools to explore the book’s themes than fully realized individuals, making it hard to care about their personal journeys. Even the antagonist, King Haggard, fails to leave a lasting impression. His motivations are thin, his actions predictable, and his presence more symbolic than tangible. While he embodies the emptiness of greed and the fear of loss, his portrayal is so shallow that he comes across as a generic villain rather than a compelling threat. Finally, the book’s reliance on flowery, overly ornate prose can be alienating. While Beagle’s writing is undoubtedly beautiful, it often feels more concerned with being lyrical than with serving the story. Passages that could have been evocative instead become tedious, bogged down by an excess of description and metaphor. In conclusion, while The Last Unicorn has moments of beauty and brilliance, it ultimately falters under the weight of its ambition. Its tonal inconsistencies, meandering plot, and underdeveloped characters make it a challenging and, at times, frustrating read. For those who value narrative cohesion and emotional depth over stylistic flourish, the book may feel more like a missed opportunity than a masterpiece.

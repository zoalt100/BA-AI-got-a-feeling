Peter S Beagle’s The Last Unicorn has long been regarded as a seminal work of fantasy, celebrated for its poetic prose and deep themes of loss and transformation. However, for all its acclaim, the book falls short in several critical areas that make it a divisive reading experience. While some adore its dreamy, allegorical qualities, others find its execution tedious, overly sentimental, and lacking the kind of narrative drive that makes for a truly compelling story. One of the most immediate challenges of The Last Unicorn is its pacing, which can generously be described as slow. The plot unfolds in a languid, episodic manner, with little sense of urgency or forward momentum. While this might reflect the timeless existence of the unicorn herself, it results in a story that feels unfocused and meandering. The narrative is filled with philosophical asides, whimsical detours, and interactions that don’t seem to meaningfully advance the plot. As a result, key moments—such as the unicorn’s transformation into a human or her confrontation with King Haggard—feel rushed or unearned, leaving readers unsatisfied. The unicorn herself is a problematic protagonist. While her otherworldly detachment is thematically appropriate, it also makes her feel distant and unrelatable. She spends much of the book as a passive observer, reacting to the world around her but rarely taking decisive action to shape her journey. Even her transformation into a human, which should be a moment of vulnerability and growth, is treated more as a plot device than an opportunity for character development. Her struggles with mortality and identity are barely explored, robbing the story of much of its emotional potential. The supporting characters fare little better. Schmendrick the magician, while charming in his bumbling ineptitude, feels like a stock character whose arc lacks depth or complexity. His journey to become a true wizard is glossed over, and his interactions with the unicorn often serve more as vehicles for Beagle’s themes than as meaningful character moments. Similarly, Molly Grue, who begins as a jaded realist, has flashes of poignancy but is ultimately underutilized. Her bitterness and world-weariness are explored only superficially, and her relationship with the unicorn never quite achieves the emotional resonance it seems to aim for. King Haggard, the story’s primary antagonist, is emblematic of the book’s broader weaknesses. While he is intended to be a symbol of greed and the hollowness of hoarding beauty, he is written in such a vague and one-dimensional way that he never feels like a truly compelling threat. His motivations are underdeveloped, his dialogue lacks depth, and his presence in the story feels more symbolic than tangible. Without a strong antagonist, the stakes of the story are diminished, making the climax feel anticlimactic. Finally, Beagle’s prose, while undeniably beautiful, can be alienating. His lyrical descriptions and philosophical musings often feel overly ornate, bogging down the narrative rather than enhancing it. While some readers appreciate the poetic quality of his writing, others find it tedious and self-indulgent. The book’s emphasis on style over substance can make it difficult to engage with the story on an emotional level, leaving readers feeling detached from the characters and their struggles. In the end, The Last Unicorn is a novel that prioritizes its themes and aesthetics over its plot and characters, which makes it a polarizing experience. While its exploration of loss, identity, and beauty is admirable, the book’s slow pacing, distant protagonist, and lack of emotional depth prevent it from being the timeless classic it’s often made out to be. For readers who prefer a more grounded and engaging narrative, The Last Unicorn might feel more like a missed opportunity than a masterpiece.

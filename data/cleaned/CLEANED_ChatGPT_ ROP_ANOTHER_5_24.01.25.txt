The Rings of Power, Amazon’s much-hyped and astronomically expensive foray into the world of Middle-earth, promised to bring JRR Tolkien’s beloved universe to life in a way that no other adaptation had before. With a budget of nearly a billion dollars and the weight of Tolkien’s legacy on its shoulders, expectations were understandably high. Unfortunately, the show fell short of delivering a meaningful or satisfying experience. Despite its lavish production values and promising concept, The Rings of Power struggles with weak storytelling, poorly developed characters, and a general lack of the magic and depth that make Tolkien’s world so timeless. One of the most significant issues with The Rings of Power is its failure to capture the tone and essence of Tolkien’s work. Tolkien’s stories are deeply rooted in themes of friendship, sacrifice, and the enduring battle between good and evil, woven together with a poetic and deliberate style. The show, on the other hand, feels like a superficial imitation of these themes, prioritizing spectacle over substance. Instead of honoring Tolkien’s intricate world-building, the series leans heavily on modern television tropes, creating a version of Middle-earth that feels disconnected from the source material. The dialogue, for instance, often lacks the gravitas and lyricism of Tolkien’s writing, instead resorting to cliched lines that feel out of place in such a storied world. The characters, who should be the emotional heart of any great series, are another weak point. Galadriel, one of the most iconic and enigmatic figures in Tolkien’s legendarium, is transformed into a one-dimensional warrior archetype. While it’s understandable to reimagine her as a younger, more active character, the execution lacks nuance, reducing her to an overly stubborn and unrelatable figure. Other characters, like Elrond and Durin, fare slightly better but still feel underdeveloped, as their arcs are rushed or bogged down by unengaging subplots. The show introduces a host of new, original characters, yet few leave a lasting impression. Instead of deepening the viewer’s connection to Middle-earth, these characters often feel like they’ve been pulled from a generic fantasy series. The narrative itself is another major disappointment. The Rings of Power attempts to weave multiple storylines across Middle-earth, but the pacing is uneven, and the stories often fail to converge in a satisfying way. Key plot points are either telegraphed far in advance or lack sufficient buildup, robbing them of their intended impact. The mystery surrounding Sauron’s identity, for example, feels forced and predictable, while other subplots, like the adventures of the Harfoots, drag on without meaningful progression. The show’s attempts at political intrigue and action sequences also fall flat, lacking the tension and emotional stakes that make such moments memorable. While The Rings of Power undeniably excels in its production design—boasting breathtaking landscapes, stunning costumes, and impressive visual effects—these elements cannot compensate for the show’s deeper flaws. Middle-earth looks beautiful, but it feels hollow, as if the creators prioritized aesthetics over storytelling. Ultimately, The Rings of Power is a disappointing adaptation that fails to live up to its potential. It may look the part, but it lacks the soul and depth of Tolkien’s work. For fans of Middle-earth, it’s a frustrating reminder that no amount of money can replace strong writing, thoughtful characterization, and a true understanding of what makes a story timeless.

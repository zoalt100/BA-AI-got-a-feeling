The Last Unicorn by Peter S Beagle is often considered a masterpiece of fantasy literature, beloved for its poetic language and themes of loss and transformation. However, despite its widespread acclaim, the book left me feeling underwhelmed and disconnected. While I can appreciate its artistic ambitions, the execution of its story and characters left much to be desired, making it a frustrating read rather than an enchanting experience. One of the most glaring issues with The Last Unicorn is its pacing. The narrative often feels aimless, meandering from one episode to the next without a strong sense of momentum or purpose. While this could be seen as reflective of the unicorn’s timeless existence and her gradual awakening to the mortal world, it makes the story feel disjointed and unfocused. Key events that should carry emotional weight—such as her discovery of the truth about her kind or her transformation into a human—are treated with a detachment that undermines their impact. The plot lacks the urgency and cohesion needed to keep readers engaged, instead opting for a dreamy, almost lethargic progression. The unicorn herself is a central point of frustration. While she is meant to embody an ethereal and otherworldly presence, her aloof nature makes her difficult to connect with as a protagonist. She is passive for much of the story, reacting to the world around her rather than driving the plot forward. This passivity can make her journey feel less like a quest and more like a series of events happening to her. Her transformation into a human is intended to add depth and vulnerability, but the transition feels abrupt and underdeveloped, leaving little time to explore the profound implications of her newfound mortality. The supporting characters, while more dynamic, still fall short of their potential. Schmendrick, the incompetent magician, and Molly Grue, the hardened realist, are compelling in theory but lack the depth to make them truly memorable. Schmendrick’s journey from ineptitude to competence is underplayed, while Molly’s bitterness and cynicism feel repetitive rather than nuanced. Their interactions with the unicorn often serve more as vehicles for the book’s themes than as opportunities for genuine character development. Even the book’s central antagonist, King Haggard, fails to leave a lasting impression. While his obsession with the unicorns is meant to symbolize the emptiness of greed and the futility of clinging to beauty, his character is too one-dimensional to make these ideas resonate. His motivations are thinly sketched, and he lacks the complexity or menace needed to be a truly compelling villain. Finally, while the prose is undoubtedly beautiful, it can also feel overwrought and self-indulgent. Beagle’s writing is filled with lyrical descriptions and philosophical musings, but these often come at the expense of clarity and narrative drive. The constant emphasis on themes of loss and longing can feel heavy-handed, turning what could have been poignant moments into cloying sentimentality. In the end, The Last Unicorn feels more like a work of art to be admired from a distance than a story to be immersed in. Its pacing, underdeveloped characters, and overly sentimental tone detract from its strengths, leaving it a disappointing read for those who prefer a more grounded and engaging narrative. While it’s easy to see why some readers cherish the book, its flaws make it difficult to truly love.

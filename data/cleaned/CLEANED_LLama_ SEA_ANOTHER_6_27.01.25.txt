The movie "Tales from Earthsea" is a 2006 Japanese animated fantasy film directed by Gorō Miyazaki, based on the Earthsea series by Ursula K Le Guin. While the movie has its fans, it has also received criticism from some viewers and critics. One of the primary reasons why some viewers may dislike the movie is its slow and meandering pace. The story is often described as plodding and overly introspective, with long stretches of dialogue and exposition that can feel tedious or boring to some viewers. Another issue with "Tales from Earthsea" is its lack of a clear and compelling narrative arc. The movie's storyline is often disjointed and fragmented, with multiple plot threads and characters that feel disconnected from one another. The movie's attempts to create tension and suspense often fall flat, with many plot twists and turns feeling predictable and unoriginal. The movie's pacing is also inconsistent, with some scenes feeling like they are dragging on forever and others feeling like they are rushing through important plot points. The movie's characters are also a point of contention for some viewers. While the protagonist, Arren, is a complex and intriguing character, some of the other characters in the movie feel underdeveloped or one-dimensional. The movie's portrayal of female characters, in particular, has been criticized for being limited or stereotypical, with some viewers feeling that the female characters are not given enough agency or depth. The movie's world-building is also a topic of debate among viewers. While the movie's visuals and production design are stunning, the world of Earthsea feels somewhat generic or unoriginal, with some viewers feeling that the movie does not adequately explore the complexities and nuances of the Earthsea universe. The movie's use of magic and fantasy elements can also feel somewhat clichéd or predictable, with some viewers feeling that the movie does not bring anything new or interesting to the fantasy genre. Furthermore, some viewers may be disappointed by the movie's handling of its source material. The movie is based on the Earthsea series by Ursula K Le Guin, but it often feels like the movie is deviating from the original story in ways that are unnecessary and unfaithful to the source material. This can be frustrating for fans of the book series who were looking forward to seeing their favorite characters and storylines brought to life on the big screen. The movie's themes and symbolism are also a point of contention for some viewers. While the movie explores complex themes such as balance, harmony, and the nature of good and evil, some viewers may feel that the movie's message is overly simplistic or heavy-handed. The movie's use of symbolism, such as the dragon and the shadow, can also feel somewhat obvious or clichéd, with some viewers feeling that the movie is trying too hard to be clever or meaningful. Overall, while "Tales from Earthsea" has its fans, it is not a movie that will appeal to everyone. The movie's slow pace, lack of a clear narrative arc, and underdeveloped characters may be off-putting to some viewers. The movie's world-building and handling of its source material may also be disappointing to fans of the Earthsea series. However, it's worth noting that the movie is still a beautifully animated and thought-provoking film that explores complex themes and ideas. With some patience and an open mind, viewers may find that "Tales from Earthsea" is a rewarding and engaging movie that offers a unique and compelling viewing experience.

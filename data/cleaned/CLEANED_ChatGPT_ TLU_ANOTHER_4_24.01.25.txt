Peter S Beagle’s The Last Unicorn is often regarded as a fantasy classic, praised for its lyrical prose and enchanting story. However, while the book has its admirers, it is far from universally loved. For some readers, the novel falls short due to its slow pacing, overly abstract storytelling, and lack of character depth. Despite its reputation, The Last Unicorn can be a frustrating read that struggles to balance its poetic aspirations with the demands of a compelling narrative. The story begins with the titular unicorn learning that she might be the last of her kind, prompting her to set off on a quest to uncover the fate of the other unicorns. While this premise is rich with potential, the execution is far less satisfying. The plot meanders through a series of disjointed encounters that feel more like loosely connected parables than a cohesive journey. The pacing is sluggish, often bogged down by long stretches of introspection and dialogue that fail to move the story forward. By the time the climax arrives, it feels less like the culmination of an epic quest and more like a perfunctory conclusion to an uneven narrative. The unicorn herself, as the protagonist, is one of the book’s weakest elements. While her otherworldly detachment is thematically appropriate, it also makes her a difficult character to connect with. She is more a passive observer than an active participant in her own story, relying on others to propel the plot forward. Even when she is transformed into a human—a moment that should deepen her character and raise the emotional stakes—it feels underexplored. Her internal conflict and growth are hinted at but never fully developed, leaving her arc feeling shallow and unsatisfying. The supporting characters, though more dynamic, also fail to leave a lasting impression. Schmendrick, the hapless magician, is intended to provide comic relief and a touch of pathos, but his bumbling antics often feel repetitive and grating. His journey to master his powers lacks the depth needed to make it truly compelling. Molly Grue, meanwhile, is introduced as a bitter realist, but her potential as a grounding, emotionally resonant character is undermined by her tendency to lapse into melodrama. Both characters feel like archetypes rather than fully realized individuals, making it difficult to care about their fates. The antagonist, King Haggard, is another disappointment. While he is meant to symbolize greed and the emptiness of hoarding beauty, his portrayal lacks nuance. He is little more than a brooding figure lurking in his castle, with motivations that are shallow and unconvincing. His role as the story’s villain feels more symbolic than substantial, reducing the tension and stakes of the narrative. Finally, Beagle’s prose, though often praised for its beauty, can be a double-edged sword. The writing is rich with metaphor and symbolism, but this can make the story feel overly abstract and distant. Moments that should be emotionally impactful are buried under layers of flowery language, making it difficult to fully engage with the text. What might be evocative to some readers comes across as pretentious or overly sentimental to others. In the end, The Last Unicorn is a book that prioritizes style and theme over plot and character, which can alienate readers looking for a more grounded and engaging story. Its pacing, lack of emotional resonance, and underdeveloped characters make it a challenging read, leaving it more of an acquired taste than a universally appealing classic.
